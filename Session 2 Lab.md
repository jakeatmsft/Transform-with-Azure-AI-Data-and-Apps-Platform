# Copilot application that implements RAG

This is a sample copilot that application that implements RAG via custom Python code, and can be used with the Azure AI Studio. This sample aims to provide a starting point for an enterprise copilot grounded in custom data that you can further customize to add additional intelligence or capabilities.  

Following the below steps, you will: set up your development environment, create or reference your Azure AI resources, explore prompts, build an index containing product information, run your copilot, evaluate it, and deploy your copilot to a managed endpoint.
