# Transform with Azure AI, Data and Apps Platform!

Welcome to the Innovate. Ignite. Inspire : Transform with Azure AI, Data and Apps Platform workshop! In this workshop, we’ll talk about these emerging patterns and show how Azure AI empowers developers to build multi-agent copilot solutions. Discover advanced features such as model selection, debugging tools and security measures for developing intelligent, scalable, and safe AI solutions.
You will learn about:
- Build high-quality LLM-based applications with Azure AI Services and Azure AI Studio
- Operationalize and scale the management of your GenAI applications
- Innovate confidently by building and designing with responsible AI practices

This workshop can be delivered in 8 hours. It has 5 sessions(some sessions can be made optional based on customer scenarios)  and 3 labs.

**Session 1 - Azure AI product family and API/Model Choice:**
Provides an overview of Azure AI product family and help identify the best AI services and models for Customer's use case
Followed by Lab 1

**Session 2 - Complete AI Toolchain:**
Access collaborative, comprehensive tooling to support the development lifecycle and differentiate your apps including tools to ground models, orchestrate and debug AI workflows, model evaluations
Followed by Lab 2

**Session 3 - Responsible AI Tools & Practices:**
Design and safeguard applications using configurable filters and controls. Confidently build apps with technologies, templates, and best practices to help manage risk, improve accuracy, protect privacy, reinforce transparency, and simplify compliance.
Followed by Lab 3

**Session 4 - Enterprise-grade Production at Scale:**
Deploy AI innovations to Azure's managed infrastructure with continuous monitoring and governance across environments. How to enterprise scale the deployment using Azure API management

**Session 5 - Choose where to build your copilot:**
Differentiate Copilot Studio, Azure AI studio and AI toolkit for VS code and choose where to build your copilot
